# Caesar Cypher

This script was made as a hobby to help with a task in a challenge called [30 days lost in space](https://inventr.io/courses/adventurekit30dayslostinspace/).

The task at hand asked us to translate a C++ code that was encripted using an old Caesar Cypher. It can be used to translate any text encripted with Caesar Cypher, you need to input the path where your txt file is, the name of the file (including the .txt) and lastly the offset used in the encryption.
