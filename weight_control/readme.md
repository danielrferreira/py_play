# Weight Control Helper
This is a simple script that show your weight graph, and ask you to input your weight, exercise and nutrition level. After saving the data to a csv, it shows you again the week report and the updated graph. It is supposed to run in terminal automatically. I am still trying to figure out how to add a desktop shortcut.
