## Context

In the past 15 years I used a combination of SAS, SQL and R to accomplish my analytical tasks. I am moving to Python since it became the most popular language to run Machine Learning algorithms. This repository will contain some random fun codes I create while I go deeper on the language. Don't expect nothing too serious. Check my STETV repository for more data related tasks.
